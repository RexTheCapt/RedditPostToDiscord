# RedditPostToDiscord
I have no idea why i really made this but enjoy, i guess...

This bot will go thru the top 25 posts (no idea how to change this number) on r/blursedimages every X seconds.
This bot does not download the images to send them, it will just take the URL and send it as an normal message on discord.

## How to use:
Build the program then run it. The setup is done thru the console.
Press Q anytime in the console to stop it. This is the only time where it will save the settings and the list of sent images.

## Explanation on the setup steps:
### Please input bot token:
This is where you go to the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) on [discord.com](https://discord.com/) to get an bot token.
Use that token here.

### Please input target channel ID:
This is where you get the channels ID to send the messages to.
The input is required to be an number, you have to retry this step if anything else is in the input.

### Please input delay in seconds to send image:
Pretty self explanatory, this is where you add the delay in seconds (required to be an number)

### Input general channel ID:
If you want to you can add an channel to send the image to randomly from 0 sec (very low chance) to 24 hours, number required.
(hour, min and seconds are randomized).

### Please input subreddit:
Input the subreddit you want to take the posts from, possible to change this reddit later by typing r/<subreddit> in the selected discord channel.
